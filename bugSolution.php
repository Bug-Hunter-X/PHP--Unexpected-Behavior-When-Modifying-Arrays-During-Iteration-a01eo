The problem is solved by avoiding modification of the array during iteration.  Here are two approaches:

**Approach 1: Create a copy**

```php
function modifyArrayCopy(array $arr) {
  $newArray = [];
  foreach ($arr as $value) {
    $newArray[] = $value * 2; 
  }
  return $newArray;
}

$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
$modifiedNumbers = modifyArrayCopy($numbers);
echo "Modified Array: ";
print_r($modifiedNumbers); //Correct output
```

**Approach 2: Iterate over a copy of the keys:**

```php
function modifyArrayKeys(array &$arr) {
  $keys = array_keys($arr);
  foreach ($keys as $key) {
    $arr[$key] *= 2;
  }
}

$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
modifyArrayKeys($numbers);
echo "Modified Array: ";
print_r($numbers); // Correct output
```

Both approaches ensure that array elements are not modified during iteration, preventing unexpected behavior.  The first creates a new array, while the second iterates through keys, allowing modification without interference.
